### Internal Projects
This year's project steams directly from the stack I proposed outside of last year's LEIOT project (which focused on Radio Technologies). 
That proposal already focused on an above-IP layer solution using the standards we are now betting on: IPv6,  CoAP,  LWM2M,  IPSO.

While last year's targeted only Bootstrapping,  this year's intends to offer full Lifecycle Management.  Only Mert, Adriano and I participated on the original prototype design and implementation.

From this years' target I am authoring the following core documents (so far by myself)

**REST-based constrained device management with LWM2M**

This document synthesizes the [LWM2M] Specification and explains how it is used for device management and IoT applications over [RFC7252].  It summarizes the LWM2M Specification and its core functions: Secure Bootstrapping, Device Registration, Device Management, Service Enablement and Information Reporting. Moreover it provides examples and explanations on how to use LWM2M for IoT Applications that make use of the OMA and [IPSO] Object Model.

**Publish/Subscribe device management with MQTT and integration with LWM2M**

This document provides a summary of [MQTT] and how it can be used for device management. Its target is to give an overview on how to perform well-known management functions with [MQTT] and similar publish/subscribe protocols. This document also contains links to the relevant state of the art in the Device Management Area with MQTT [MQTT-DM] , LWMQN and others also providing a comparison with existing [REST] protocols like CoAP [RFC7252] as well as other alternatives such as the CoAP PubSub broker [I-D.koster-core-coap-pubsub]. It also explains some ways of doing LWM2M type of management over MQTT.

**IoT Semantic Interoperability State of the Art**

This document provides a summary of the IAB Workshop on IoT Semantic Interoperability (IOTSI) [IOTSIWS], which took place in Santa Clara, CA, on March 17-18, 2016. The main goal of the workshop was to foster a discussion on the different Semantics used by multiple organizations to define IoT information. This report summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) community. It also provides an overview of the problems in the IoT Semantic Interoperability space.

----------

### External Collaboration
* Key driver and contributor of Horizon 2020 project HII, tasks 4 and 5.
* Previously participated in various other External collaboration projects: MAMMOTH, COMMUNE, IOTSHOK, ...

----------

### Inventions
* This year already 3 accepted (all above IP layer), 2 in progress.
* Total of 17 (estimation)

----------

### Prototyping
* The current prototype has been done by 3 thesis students whose thesis I suggested and supervised over the last years. The architecture was done by two of use following IoT standards. 
* I currently do performance tests on MQTT.js (as opposed to CoAP), I participated on the original Distributed CoAP implementation.

----------

### Miscellaneous
* Thesis supervision of 4 TRI thesis students on the last 3 years, currently supervising another one. 
* Guiding students from Design Factory and Åbo Akademi to participate and win on a start-up prototyping contest (Design Factory).  
*  Organizer of the most successful (and the last) NomadicLab Day (2014)
*  Proposing innovative ideas before they were cool and driving the actual tangible IoT work on GFT. 
* Many others that I already forgot.
