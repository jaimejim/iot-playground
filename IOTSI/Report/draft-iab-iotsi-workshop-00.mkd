--- abstract
This document provides a summary of the 'Workshop on Internet of Things (IoT) Semantic Interoperability (IOTSI)' {{IOTSIWS}}, which took place in Santa Clara, CA, on March 17-18, 2016.  The main goal of the workshop was to foster a discussion on the different approaches used by companies and standards developing organizations to accomplish interoperability at the application layer.  This report summarizes the discussions and lists recommendations to the standards community. The views and positions in this report are those of the workshop participants and do not necessarily reflect those of the authors and the Internet Architecture Board (IAB), which organized the workshop.

Introduction
============

The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet architecture. The investigated topics often require coordinated efforts of many organizations and industry bodies to improve an identified problem. One of the targets of the workshops is to establish communication between relevant organizations, specially when the topics are out of the scope for the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). This long-term planning function of the IAB is complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working groups of the IETF. 

Increasing interoperability in the area of Internet of Things (IoT) has been a top priority for many standards organizations and pariticularly the lower layers of the Internet protocol stack have received a lot of attention. Also at the application layer, such as with CoAP and HTTP, there is a trend in reusing RESTful design patterns. However, data exchanged on top of these application layer protocols there is still a lot of fragmentation and the same degree of increase in interoperability has not been observed.

Thus, the IAB decided to organize a workshop to reach out to relevant stakeholders to explore the state-of-the-art and to identify communality and gaps. 

  * The different perceived state of the art on data and information models. 
  * The lack of an encoding-independent standardization of the information, the so-called information model.
  * The strong relationship with the underlying communication pattern, such as remote procedure calls (RPC), publish/subscribe or RESTful designs.
  * Identifying which similar concepts groups have develop in parallel, specially those that would require only slight modifications to solve interoperability.
  * Identifying how existing data models can be mapped against each other to offer inter working. 
  * Identifying common use cases for cooperation and harmonization.

Terminology
===========

The first roadblock to semantic interoperability is the lack of a common vocabulary to start the discussion. There is a need to align between participating organizations on a common set of basic terms. {{RFC3444}} does a start by separating conceptual models for designers or Information Models (IMs) and concrete detailed definitions for implementors or Data Models (DMs). There are concepts that are undefined in that RFC and elsewhere, such as the interaction with the resources of an endpoint or Interaction Model. Therefore the three "main" common models that could be identified were:

Information Model (IM)
: it defines an environment at the highest level of abstraction, they express the desired functionality. They can be defined informally (e.g. in plain English) or more formally (e.g. UML, Entity-Relationship Diagrams, etc.). Implementation details are hidden. 

Data Model (DM)
: it defines concrete data representations at a lower level of abstraction, including implementation and protocol-specific details. Some examples are: SNMP Management Information Base (MIBs), W3C Thing Description (TD) Things, YANG models, LWM2M Schemas, OCF Schemas and so on. 

Interaction Model (IN)
: it defines how data is accessed and retrieved from the endpoints, being therefore tied to the specific communication pattern that the system has (e.g. REST methods, Publish/Subscribe operations or RPC-calls).

Another identified terminology issue is the semantic meaning overload that some terms have. Meaning will vary depending on the context the term is used. Some examples of such terms are: semantics, models, encoding, serialization format, media types or encoding types. Due to time constraints no concrete terminology was agreed upon, however work will continue within each organization to create various terminology documents, see {{IOTSIGIT}}.

Architecture
============

Architectures follow different design patterns, some are REST-oriented with clear methods to find and manipulate resources on endpoints with almost no state kept between them. Others are more Publish/Subscribe-oriented that focus on the flow of information based on the topics of the information that is being shared. Others are RPC-like requiring to know beforehand the set of parameters that are accessed, requiring to generate code both on the client and server side, they are tightly coupled and service-oriented.

Thing-hub-cloud 
: things talk to a hub, which talks back to them and to the cloud. There is a spectrum of emphasis on the hub vs. the cloud. For some the hub is simply an access point; for others it is a critical place for control loops and ALGs.

Meta Thing 
: some things are actually virtual, like an alarm composed of clock, lights, and thermostat.

Nearby things
: some things may be geospatially related even if they are not on the same network or within the same administrative domain.

Current data models and definitions for "things" often focus on defining actual physical devices and representing their state. That focus should perhaps be shifted into a more holistic or user-oriented perspective, defining abstract concepts as well. On the other a lot of focus is placed on human interaction with physical devices while IoT will be more oriented to interaction between "things" instead.

Those things should be designed to be multiple-purpose, keeping in mind that solutions should be open-ended to facilitate new usages and new future domains of operation. this pattern has already happened, devices that were intended for one purpose end up being used for a different one given the right context ((e.g. smart phone led light turned out to be a heartrate monitor).
IoT domain is currently missing insights into what user actually expect. 


What Problems to Solve
======================
 
Although the workshop focused on a specific problem it became obvious from the position papers that various organizations, industry groups and individuals attempted to solve different problems. At least the following goals have been described:  

  * Formal Languages for Documentation Purposes

Standardization organizations are in the need for a more formal description of their information and data models in order to simplify review, and publication. For example, the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) used an XML schema {{LWM2M-Schema}} to describe their object definitions (i.e., data model) as XML instance documents. These XML documents offer an alternative way of describing objects compared to the tabular representation found in the specification itself. The XML files of standardized objects are available for download at {{OMNA}}. Furthermore, a tool is offered to define new objects and resources. The online editor tool can be found at {{OMA-Editor}}.
   
   * Formal Languages for Code Generation

Formal data and information modelling languages for use by developers to enable code generation. For example, the Allseen Visual Studio Plugin {{Allseen-Plugin}} offers a wizzard to generate code based on the formal description of the data model. Another example of a data modelling language that can be used for code generation is YANG. A popular tool to help with code generation of YANG modules is pyang {{PYANG}}. 
   
   * Debugging Support

Ability to allow debugging tools to implement generic object browsers by utilizing the standardized information and data model. Example: NRF Bluetooth Smart sniffer from Nordic Semiconductor {{nRF-Sniffer}}. 

   * Translation

The ability for gateways and other similar devices to dynamically translate (or map) one data model to another one. An example of this idea can be found in {{UDI}}.    
   
   * Runtime Discovery

Allow IoT devices to exchange information, potentially along with the data exchange, to discover meta-data about the data and, potentially, even a self-describing interaction model. An example of such an approach has been shown with HATEOS {{HATEOS}}.


Translation
============

One of the targets of interoperability is to create translators between the data models. There are analogies with gateways back in 1985 when they were used to translate between network protocols, eventually IP took over providing interoperability, however we lost some of the features provided by those other protocols. The creation of an equivalent "hub/s" that offer translation between the different data models or data semantics seems one of the ways forward. Some lose of expressiveness due to the translation between models seems also unavoidable. 

When it comes to translation two different distinctions appear: translating data between data models and translating data models. The first one implies doing the translation at runtime while the second performs one translation between the data models one time, like translating a YANG model to a RAML/JSON one. Indeed, for every IM multiple DMs could be translated. 

In a sense these distinctions affect as to when the translation is performed. It can be done at "design time" when the information model is done, it can be done at runtime for a concrete data model and it can be done depending n the actual serialization. 

Yet another distinction will appear depending on the requirements from the application protocols, RPC-style ones might require a slightly different DM than REST ones for similar operations, for example SNMP-traps could be similar to CoAP-Observations but not quite the same. It is easier to translate between systems that follow the same architecture/design pattern than across architectures, full translation might not even be possible (e.g. stateless vs stateful systems).

Translation of models script to translate XML to YANG
Translation of serialized data, on a hub  in order to normalize it to other data model.


Runtime Discovery
=================

Runtime changes are doing after design and at compile time. 
Discovery, is it devices or data items on devices. 
A lot of people think about devices but also abstract entities. 
To do discovery one question is "how much must "be shared before time. 
The meta-data has also two possible notions, is it instance specific (e.g. location of the thing) or does it have to do with the model itself?

Need to handle change in the environment. Replace things without manual configuration, change control flow, etc. at runtime. 
Few things (vocabulary) is shared a priori. 
Drives the application runtime, "Engine of application state", we needs self-describing interaction models.
Ravi: nothing prevents HATEOAS + data model
Ari: And OMA LwM2M uses SenML 
Matthias: these are complementary approaches. It is to point out that it is also about Interaction Models. Of course DM are needed to convey data.


Interaction model

You get one entry point (in CoAP it is the RD) and the client tries to perform discovery in order to find and follow links in order to discover capabilities. You submit forms to interact with them. This way you can create processes that span over multiple devices involved in the process. If later one you find that you need something else, you can add new functionality at runtime, next client that comes along will have the same logic but see different capabilities of functionality and therefore use it. 

Parts of the information have to be shared a priori. The process is incremental, but once discovered, you don't need to perform the same operation every time, you can go to the bookmark. 

The following are examples of all those in HTML. 

~~~~~~~~~~~ html
// Links (Anchors) with human-readable information
<a href="about.html">More information</a>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

// Templated Links to perform a query with a parameter.
<form method="get" action="search.php">
  <input id="query" type="text">
</form>

// Embedded Links which are used to embed other resources.
<img src="logo.png">
<audio src="audio.ogg">
<video src="video.mp4">

// Forms with the concrete method to be used and the 
<form method="post" action="">
  <input id="name" type="text">
  <input id="age" type="text">
  <input id="homepage" type="text">
</form>
~~~~~~~~~~~

The challenge is to define the human-readable parts as machine-readable. For that a vocabulary is necessary to give meaning to the tags. Such information needs to be share beforehand. 

In some models everything has to be shared from the beginning, therefore any change would involve changing the whole "framework". By forcing to share only the bare minimum, you avoid such problem.

Some organizations have created predefined interfaces, all of them are predefined and described, they even provide code generation. The device logic has to support such interfaces, no changes are possible at runtime. 

Data models have common elements that have the property of composition. Often alliances provide repositories for data models, static definitions of "things" and how to composed them. With links and composition, you can create more dynamic interactions and describe the environment so that it is discovered in runtime. On top of that there can be annotations with the notion of interfaces. There are also discovery mechanisms where anything related to the state of a thing can be discovered. 

You have to know the vocabulary used a priori, basic assumptions for discovery, there is a handle that will point. 

The challenge is to have the features that are exposed and modeled (DM and IM) and to keep the backwards compatibility. As well as having the capability to provide new features in the future. 

All of this is done in the case that we want to have something better than just having firmware updates every time.  

BLE they have an additional discovery services and some metadata that refers to the data type. A generic client could understand some of the characteristics. The interaction model is not something to be easily reconstructed. With HATEOAS and OCF's approach, it seems that you can learn how to interact with the device with that metadata.
Let's say that we don't need that crap, it is not useful. If someone wants a device he can just download some software and use it. for some of the use cases it is needed. if I buy a heart rate monitor. i can do that as a developer i dont want to use that. It is also needed to keep the support the prior features. Also if I want to change vendor. The notion is that after discovery I know how to use it eve if I don't know what it is. 

It depends also on how do you see the programming environment. 
translation from one data model to another. gw sucks the code and does the translation. ar esome of the language so powerful to do that? prototype to do something
