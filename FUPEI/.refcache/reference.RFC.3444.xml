<abstract><t>There has been ongoing confusion about the differences between Information Models and Data Models for defining managed objects in network management.  This document explains the differences between these terms by analyzing how existing network management model specifications (from the IETF and other bodies such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) or the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF)) fit into the universe of Information Models and Data Models. This memo documents the main results of the 8th workshop of the Network Management Research Group (NMRG) of the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) hosted by the University of Texas at Austin.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.</t></abstract>
